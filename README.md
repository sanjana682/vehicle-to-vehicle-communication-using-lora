INTRODUCTION

Through low-power, long-distance communication, the Vehicle-to-Vehicle (V2V) Communication System Using LoRa with Arduino aims to enhance road safety. Using Arduino Uno and Nano, the framework coordinates LoRa TX/RX modules, ultrasonic sensors, GPS, and a LCD. Through LoRa, vehicles exchange real-time data like location, speed, and distance to keep safe distances and monitor their surroundings. GPS and ultrasonic sensors provide crucial collision prevention data. By facilitating timely data sharing between vehicles, this system improves traffic management and safety, making it suitable for both urban and rural settings.
Arduino microcontrollers, which act as each vehicle's central processing units, are the building blocks of the system. Displays, ultrasonic sensors, GPS modules, LoRa transceivers, and other sensors and modules are all connected to these microcontrollers. The GPS module provides precise location data, while the ultrasonic sensor is used to measure the distance between vehicles. The LoRa handset works with correspondence among vehicles, and the showcase of vehicles.
The primary goal of V2V communication is to enhance road safety, traffic management, and fuel efficiency. By enabling vehicles to communicate, drivers can receive warnings of potential collisions, sudden braking, or upcoming hazards, allowing for better decision-making and quicker reaction times. In the long term, V2V is expected to support the development of fully autonomous vehicles by allowing seamless interaction between them.
Key benefits include reduced road accidents, improved traffic flow, and more efficient route planning. However, challenges such as ensuring data security, standardization, and the integration of V2V with existing infrastructure remain areas of active research and development.
